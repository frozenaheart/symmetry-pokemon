This project is a pokedex app.

## Tech Stack

This project used React, Typescript, Chakra-ui, Context, Styled Components, Jest, React-Testing-Library

## High-Level User Stories to Cover

**User Story 1**: You can search a catalog of Pokemon characters (Pokedex) by their name or by some of the characters in their name in order to return one or more Pokemon and their trading card attributes.

**User Story 2**: You can know how many (count) unique Pokemon are in the Pokedex, as well as unique Pokemon Types and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 3**: You can filter and narrow my search criteria based on Pokemon Type and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 4**: You can see pictures of the Pokemon characters with some identifying attributes (trading card information) about the creatures presented in the screen.

**User Story 5**: You can sort the order of the Pokemon characters based on one or more identifying attributes about the character.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
